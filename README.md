# RAML Server
Get a full fake REST API with **zero coding** by writing a [RAML](http://raml.org/) spec.

This is done by generating responses data by reading the JSON schemas with the [RAML Mocker](https://github.com/RePoChO/raml-mocker), and run with [JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) mapping the fake data to a ```db.json``` file.
